# Automated Traffic sign recognition system
This project aims to develop a deep learning model using Python and CNN to recognise and classify traffic signs from the collected dataset.
By leveraging the power of CNNs and optimising model performance, we strive to achieve high accuracy and reliability in traffic sign
recognition.
